We can determine which tile any point in the world is within, and this is often a fast process.
In the case of a square grid, we can simply use a characterâ€™s x and z coordinates to determine
the square it is contained in. For example:
1 tileX: int = floor(x / tileSize)
2 tileZ: int = floor(z / tileSize)
where floor is a function that returns the highest valued integer less than or equal to its
argument, and tileX and tileZ identify the tile within the regular grid of tiles.
Similarly, for localization we can use a representative point in the tile (often the center of
the tile) to convert a node back into a game location.
